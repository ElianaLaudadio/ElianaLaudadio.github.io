            <p><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">"Everytime I'm about to neglect a part of my routine, I think about the woman I'd like to be. She's consistant. Disciplined. And I can be that a second from now by doing it."</p>
            <p>Hi, my name is Eliana Laudadio. I am a dedicated and enthusiastic Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in software development and a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges.</p>
            
            <p>On a personal note, I am passionate about living a healthy lifestyle, which I attribute to my Italian-American upbringing. The values of health and wellness were instilled in me from a young age, and I love to incorporate my culture into my fitness journey—whether it's through traditional recipes made healthier or finding balance in my meals. I enjoy spending time at the gym, believing that a holistic approach to health enhances both my personal and professional life. Naturally, as the technical mind that I am, I like to incorporate my software skills to enhance my personal priorities. This is something that is showcased in my personal favorite Grocery List application project.</p>
    
            <p>With that, I am proficient in multiple programming languages—including Java, C++, and Python—and I enjoy tackling complex problems and creating efficient solutions. My personal project, a meal planning application, demonstrates my ability to integrate software development with practical value, showcasing my skills in database management and user experience design.</p>
            <p>Driven by a commitment to continuous learning and innovation, I am eager to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. I look forward to opportunities where I can further develop my skills and contribute to exciting projects.</p>
